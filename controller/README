mpd remote
version 1.2 - 2006jan07

intro
  mpd remote is a short little php app i wrote to be able to control my mpd-based jukebox from my
  mobile phone.  as a result, it is intentionally simple.  if you want more power, use another client. 
  basic playlist support is included (for predefined playlists only).


usage
  all hyperlinks on the main mpd remote page have shortcut access keys which are displayed on screen.  
  for space reasons they are not displayed exactly as they appear on the phone numberpad.  however, 
  here they are as such:

    playlist| pause  |  (3)
    --------+--------+--------
    << prev | > play | next >>
    --------+--------+--------
     vol -  |  stop  |  vol +
    --------+--------+--------
    refresh | seek 0 |  (#)

  functionality on older phones that only support hdml or wml i believe is non-existant.  this was
  written to sprintpcs' current technical recommendations, which are xhtml-mp.  xhtml-mp is a version
  of xhtml-basic slightly modified for mobile phones.


thanks
  thanks to the mpd (music player daemon) folk.  also thanks to the author of mpd-class (included) which
  made this little app insanely easy to write.

  thanks to laurent sibilla (lsibilla@skynet.be) who was responsible for the playlist code.  i only
  polished it up and fixed a couple of things.


design notes
  this was tested in my environment and found to be functional.  for reference, that environment is:
    apache 1.3.x
    php 5.0.x
    mpd 0.12.0 (almost - actually 0.11.x+svn)
    mpd-class 1.2
    sprintpcs with pcs vision
    sanyo scp-5400 phone with the netfront v3.0 browser
    palm t|x with blazer v4.3 browser

  access control is handled in apache, not the app.
  mpd daemon host, port, and password can be configured from mpd remote's index.php and playlist.php 
    files.
  the pages do not autorefresh because that sucks up needless bandwidth on a mobile connection.

feedback / contacting me
  if you find this app useful and/or you can confirm that it works on other phones or with other
  service providers, i'd love to hear about it.  you can email me at: tm@iprog.com.  suggestions are also
  welcome, although code patches are better.

thanks for taking the time to try this thing out!
